Citizenship System Overview
Core Principles of Citizenship

All people are citizens.

Citizenship is tiered, reflecting time, service, and responsibility.

Advancement is earned through government service, never forced.

Rights expand with tier, while baseline dignity is guaranteed to all.

Citizenship tiers cannot be bought, inherited, or transferred.

Citizenship Tiers

Citizenship consists of six tiers. Each tier is earned by completing a 4-year government service term.

Tier 1 Citizen (T1C) — Baseline Citizen

Entry: Automatic at birth or entry into the system

Rights & Guarantees

Full civil liberties:

regulated right to bear arms

May work in:

private sector

government jobs

No obligation to work

No voting rights

No permanent income beyond baseline

Baseline housing grants residency only and does not constitute ownership.

Government Service Rules

Only government-run jobs count toward citizenship advancement.

Private companies contracting with the government do not qualify.

Terms paused for events outside the citizen’s control.

Military service counts as government service.

Misconduct (conviction-based):

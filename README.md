System Overview — Tiered Citizenship Governance Model
Core Philosophy

This system is built on three foundational principles:

A livable baseline is a right
Every person is guaranteed the necessities required for dignity, stability, and opportunity.

Advancement is earned, never coerced
No one is forced to work. Anything beyond the baseline must be earned through voluntary contribution.

Power scales with proven service and remains accountable
Political authority is earned through time and service, limited by term caps, and always subject to public oversight.

Citizenship Structure

All individuals are citizens. Citizenship is divided into six tiers, reflecting experience, responsibility, and trust. Advancement is achieved only through government service.

Tier 1 Citizen (T1C) — Baseline Citizen

Status: Automatic for all individuals

Rights & Guarantees:

Livable baseline:

Full civil liberties:

freedom of speech (except incitement to action)

regulated right to bear arms (registration, background and mental health checks, proper storage)

No obligation to work

No income beyond baseline

No voting or leadership rights

Baseline housing grants residency only and does not constitute property ownership.

Government Structure

The government is divided into independent branches that interact only when required:

Infrastructure — logistics, roads, rail, power grids, data networks

Humanities / Human Resources — housing, utilities, healthcare, education

Transportation — state-run public transit systems

Enforcement & Defense — law enforcement and armed forces

Judicial — laws, courts, judges (all subject to removal by vote)

Financing — taxation and funding allocation

Oversight — investigates and polices all government branches and personnel

has no authority over private citizens

Leadership & Accountability

Leadership positions are appointed, not elected.

Appointments are made by councils/boards within each branch.

Eligibility for leadership depends on citizenship tier:

City → T2C+

County → T3C+

State → T4C+

Federal → T5C+

Citizens may initiate votes to:

remove leaders

remove councils that repeatedly appoint ineffective or corrupt leaders

If a leader is removed mid-term:

the next-highest authority serves as interim until year’s end

Voting System
Eligibility

Only Tier 2 Citizens and above (T2C+) may vote.

Jurisdictional Scope

City matters → city votes

County matters → county votes

State matters → state votes

Federal matters → national vote

Property-Based Voting

Property ownership grants one vote per jurisdiction, regardless of residence.

Multiple properties in the same jurisdiction do not grant additional votes.

Property in multiple jurisdictions grants one vote in each applicable jurisdiction.

Residency-Based Voting (Non-Owners)

Citizens without property may vote only if:

they reside in the jurisdiction

they were present on or before January 1st of the voting year

Restrictions

Corporate-owned property grants no voting rights.

Only natural persons with T2C+ status may vote.

Baseline vs Advancement

The government guarantees a livable baseline.

The government cannot compel:

work

job searching

community service

To gain:

property

private vehicles

luxury goods

income beyond baseline
individuals must earn it.

The baseline exists to ensure stability and opportunity for future generations, not to equalize outcomes.

Oversight Loop

Government oversees the people.

Oversight oversees the government.

The people oversee both government and oversight.

No branch is immune. No authority is unchecked.
